# Placify_LR_Model

This project predicts the placement salary (LPA) based on CGPA and IQ. The goal is to model the relationship between these features and predict LPA using three types of Linear Regression models: Single Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Linear Regression. Both self-created and sklearn implementations are used to compare the results of the models.
